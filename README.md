### What is Python?
 + Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

-----

### It is used for: 
+ web development (server-side),
+ software development,
+  mathematics,
+ system scripting.   
    
-----

### What can Python do?
+  Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
+  Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
+  Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
+  Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
+  Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

-----

### Why Python?
+  Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
+  Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
+  Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
+ Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
+ Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

-----

### Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
+ Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
+ Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
+ Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

### Python syntax:
`first block of code`
`first block of code:` <- (colon)
`....second block of code` <- (indentation)
`....second block of code:` <- (indentation & colon)
`........third block of code` <- (indentation)
`........third block of code` <- (indentation)
`....second block of code` <- (indentation)
`....second block of code` <- (indentation)
`first block of code`

-----

### Python data-types:
+ text: `str`
+ number: `int`, `float`, `complex`
+ sequence: `list`,  `tuple`,  `range`
+ mapping: `dict`
+ set: `set`,  `frozenset`
+ boolean: `bool` (True, False)
+ binary: `bytes`,  `bytearray`,  `memoryview`
+ none: `NoneType`

-----

### Getting value data-type with `type()` function:
`print( type(10) )`

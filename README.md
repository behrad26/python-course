### what is Python?
 + python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

-----

### it is used for: 
+ web development (server-side),
+ software development,
+ mathematics,
+ system scripting.   
    
-----

### what can Python do?
+  python can be used on a server to create web applications.
+  python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
+  python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
+  python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
+  python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

-----

### why Python?
+  python works on different platforms (windows, mac, linux, raspberry pi, etc).
+  python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
+  python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
+ python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. this means that prototyping can be very quick.
+ python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

-----

### python Syntax compared to other programming languages
+ python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
+ python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
+ python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

### python syntax:
`first block of code`  
`first block of code:` <- (colon)  
`....second block of code` <- (indentation)  
`....second block of code:` <- (indentation & colon)  
`........third block of code` <- (indentation)  
`........third block of code` <- (indentation)  
`....second block of code` <- (indentation)  
`....second block of code` <- (indentation)  
`first block of code`  

-----

### python data-types:
+ text: `str`
+ number: `int`, `float`, `complex`
+ sequence: `list`,  `tuple`,  `range`
+ mapping: `dict`
+ set: `set`,  `frozenset`
+ boolean: `bool` (True, False)
+ binary: `bytes`,  `bytearray`,  `memoryview`
+ none: `NoneType`

### getting value data-type with `type()` function:
`print( type(10) )`

### review (keywords)
+ ##### python history: Guido van Rossum, 1991
+ ##### what can python do and what is it used for?
+ ##### python syntax: simple and close to English
+ ##### www.mycompiler.io <- online code editor
+ ##### syntax & indentation
+ ##### python data-types:
+ + ##### text: `str` (string)
+ + ##### numbers: `int` (integer), `float` (floating point value)
+ ##### getting value data-type by `type()` function

-----
### other data-types:
+ number: `complex`
+ boolean: `bool` (`True` / `False`)

-----
### python mathematic operators
+ `+` addition: `x + y`
+ `-` subtraction: `x - y`
+ `*` multiplication `x * y`
+ `/` division `x / y`
+ `%` modulus `x % y`
+ `**` exponentiation `x ** y`
+ `//` floor division `x // y`

-----
### python comments
syntax:
##### input:
```
#this is a comment
"this is a comment"
'this is a comment'
"""this is a comment"""
'''this is a comment'''


#this is a comment
#written in
#three lines

"""
this is a comment
written in
three lines
"""

'''
this is a comment
written in
three lines
'''

print("hello to comments!") #this is another comment
#print("hello to comments!")
"print('hello to comments!')"
'print("hello to comments")'
"""print("hello to comments")"""
'''print('Hello to comments')'''
```
  
  
### output
```
hello to comments!
```
-----
### python variables
syntax: `variable_name = value`
e.g. `x = 10` (get data-type of x by: `type(x)`)
```
a = "Hello Behrad!"    #str
b = 1402               #int
c = 1402.0             #float
d = 140.2              #float
e = 18j                #complex
f = True               #bool
g = False              #bool
```
